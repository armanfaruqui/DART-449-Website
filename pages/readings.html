      <h1>Virtual Revolution: The Great Levelling</h1>

        As I write this in 2023, conversations about new technologies that are now accessible to the public seem to surround me. Sentiments of uncertainty, caution, excitement, and fear fill the air when the topic of artificial intelligence and large language models is brought up.

        Watching this documentary allowed me to reflect on how the availability of the internet to the general public was affecting the social, economic, and moral climate in America during the 80s. Just like with conversations about AI today, individuals and collectives had different attitudes toward it depending on how it affects them, and what it affords them. Counterculturists and hippies adored the accessibility to information, communication, and media that the net afforded them. Record labels and other media distribution agencies were horrified at the threat that same technology imposed on their entire business model.

        The blessings of the internet were normalized over time. Companies embraced and adapted to the challenges it created for them. A future emerged that was perhaps not as exciting for the optimists, but also not as perilous to the doubters. Will we see this pattern continue in regard to the advent of new technologies?

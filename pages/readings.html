      <h1>Virtual Revolution: The Great Levelling</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        As I write this in 2023, conversations about new technologies that are now accessible to the public seem to surround me. Sentiments of uncertainty, caution, excitement, and fear fill the air when the topic of artificial intelligence and large language models is brought up. 

      </p>

        Watching this documentary allowed me to reflect on how the availability of the internet to the general public was affecting the social, economic, and moral climate in America during the 80s. Just like with conversations about AI today, individuals and collectives had different attitudes toward it depending on how it affects them, and what it affords them. Counterculturists and hippies adored the accessibility to information, communication, and media that the net afforded them. Record labels and other media distribution agencies were horrified at the threat that same technology imposed on their entire business model.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The blessings of the internet were normalized over time. Companies embraced and adapted to the challenges it created for them. A future emerged that was perhaps not as exciting for the optimists, but also not as perilous to the doubters. Will we see this pattern continue in regard to the advent of new technologies?

      <h1 class="lauren">Lauren McCarthy: Asking the right questions
        <br /> 
      </h1>
      <p>Technology that allows a machine to listen, record, and respond to information around us has been so seamlessly integrated into our lives, to the point that it’s almost hidden from us. Those that do choose to pay closer attention to this trend, tend to focus on 2 contrasting sides of it; what the technology can and will be able to provide for us, and the danger it possibly puts us under. Lauren McCarthy attempts to acknowledge the grey area between these 2 truths by situating herself in scenarios that allow her to experience and observe this phenomenon from various unexplored angles. </p><br>
      <p>Playing the role of a family’s Alexa for a day questions the nature of the relationship between humans and artificial intelligence designed to serve the former. Allowing her behavior and decisions on a date to be determined by feedback forms filled by Amazon Turk workers in real-time questions the nature of agency in a world where we can be influenced by so much more than those physically present around us. </p><br>
      <p>What I find most interesting is her observation regarding the lack of “people skills” amongst those designing and distributing these services. Based on how these technologies are embodied and lived in each of our lives as extensions of ourselves and our social network, the lack of design and analysis through a social paradigm is something very important for each of us consumers to question.</p><br>

      <h1> Sep Kamvar and Jonathon Harris: How do YOU feel?</h1> 
      <br>
      <p>The way we as humans, both individually and collectively, think, respond, and behave is constantly evolving just as our culture, environment, and technology is too. Relying only on conventional data collection methods to form insights about the social world is limiting and unnecessary.  We can gather data from the circuitry that connects our new global village; the internet. The data that we can extract is not only extremely high in volume, but can also be argued to offer a much deeper and more personal glimpse of the humans it comes from. </p>
      <br>
      <p>In the book about their project ‘We Feel Fine’, Sep Kamvar and Jonathon Harris touch upon how internet blogs are able to inspire so much depth and vulnerability from its authors. They refer to anthropologist Michael Wesch who discusses how such technologies “offer the promise of connecting, without the strains of commitment.” Each of our thoughts and behavioural patterns have at times been dictated by the constraints imposed by the perceived nature of social relationships. Whilst this could certainly be important information for behavioural psychologists for example, it can be argued to not be reflective of each individuals honest emotional state. Whether its the physical distance or anonymity that the internet provides, the internet has become a hub for intense self reflection and personal honesty.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Sep and Jonathon were intrigued enough by it that in 2006 they built a program that would extract sentences from internet blogs, and related information to be able to eventually present a “comprehensive contemporary portrait of the world’s emotional landscape”. In 2 years they had filled a database with more than 10 million human feelings.</p>
      <br>
      <p>www.hoodmaps.com represents a less formal application of crowdsourcing human thoughts and ideas in relation to neighbourhoods in a city. Users are able to post on a map of their city their own thoughts and opinions about specific nehigbourhoods, and upvote or downvote other’s in order to make that tag more or less prominent. This resulted in a map that fesls like it belongs more to the cities public than those administrating it. In Montreal above the airport, instead of seeing the long winded tag of ‘Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport’, we see text that says ‘Warp Zone to Florida”, poking fun at the tendency of Montrealers who migrate to and from Florida regularly. </p>

      <h1>Space In the Mind of a Machine - Refik Anadol</h1> <br>
      <p>Art has the capacity to evoke thoughts, emotions, and feelings in spaces that would otherwise be devoid of any. I really loved the sentiment that Anadol expressed in his panel “Space in the Mind of the Machine” regarding the limited nature of dedicated gallery and museum spaces for the showcasing of art. “Art is for anyone” is a sentiment that guides Anadol’s passion for integrating art into more everyday spaces. </p>
      <br>
      <p> ‘Augmented structures v1-0’ is a public media art installation situated on a building next to one of Istanbul’s most bustling and alive streets. It transcodes the variety of sounds made by humans, animals, and machines strolling through it into a 3d form visualized on the wall of a building. It’s breathtakingly marvelous to look at even without the context of the patterns being contributed to by the very entities that are enjoying the spectacle. </p>
      <br>
      <p>The idea of art being for anyone and everyone, along with its potential to evoke feelings in spaces that otherwise wouldn’t be there reminded me of one of the things I found most beautiful about Karachi, the city I come from. It is often referred to as ‘the city of lights’ due to the prevalence of artificial lighting in urban spaces. Historical structures and monuments are given a sprinkle of modernity having been lit by flood, neon, or LED lights. LED strips and fairy lights decorate spaces most would not expect to be decorated. Even poorer street and moving vendors will make the extra investment to decorate their cart with some form of flashy lights. </p>
      <br>
      <p>It's easy to write this off as not being art, and to point out the tacky nature of a lot if its implementation. But if we measure it by the joy and positivity it arouses within the dense population instead of focusing on the aesthetic quality, it's far superior to most art on this planet. Karachi consists mostly of relatively poor urban spaces within a climate that does not allow for the presence of lush grasses, flowers, trees, and lakes. In our urban landscapes, we do not have a lot to stimulate our eyes besides bustling crowds of people and decaying buildings. I look forward to inshallah (God willing) augmenting spaces in Karachi to conjure joy, positivity, and charm in spaces that need it most. </p>

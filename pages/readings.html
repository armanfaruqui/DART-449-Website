        <h1>Virtual Revolution: The Great Levelling</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          As I write this in 2023, conversations about new technologies that are
          now accessible to the public seem to surround me. Sentiments of
          uncertainty, caution, excitement, and fear fill the air when the topic
          of artificial intelligence and large language models is brought up.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Watching this documentary allowed me to reflect on how the
          availability of the internet to the general public was affecting the
          social, economic, and moral climate in America during the 80s. Just
          like with conversations about AI today, individuals and collectives
          had different attitudes toward it depending on how it affects them,
          and what it affords them. Counterculturists and hippies adored the
          accessibility to information, communication, and media that the net
          afforded them. Record labels and other media distribution agencies
          were horrified at the threat that same technology imposed on their
          entire business model.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The blessings of the internet were normalized over time. Companies
          embraced and adapted to the challenges it created for them. A future
          emerged that was perhaps not as exciting for the optimists, but also
          not as perilous to the doubters. Will we see this pattern continue in
          regard to the advent of new technologies?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Only time will tell whether the same pattern will hold true for the
          introduction of new technologies like artificial intelligence and
          large language models. However, it is clear that these technologies
          have the potential to greatly impact society in many ways, both
          positive and negative. As with any new technology, there will likely
          be a period of uncertainty and debate, but ultimately, it will be up
          to us to decide how we want these technologies to shape our future.

        <h1>The Social Dilemma</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Social Dilemma discusses the possible negative effects of social
          media platforms and the deceptive tactics used by tech firms. The
          documentary highlights severe issues regarding the predatory actions
          taken by these businesses in an effort to increase user engagement.
          While the film raises important issues, it is essential to consider
          whether blaming only tech firms will help solve the problems that the
          internet and social media pose for society.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Social Dilemma's widespread attention-manipulation techniques and
          the addiction-inducing features incorporated into social media
          platforms are two of the most urgent issues it raises. These systems
          aim to maintain user interest for as long as possible, frequently at
          the cost of their well-being and mental health. The documentary adds
          significantly to the ongoing conversation about how technology affects
          our lives by drawing attention to these predatory behaviors.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I don’t think that just focusing on the tech industry in addressing
          these problems is the ideal solution. As essential as it is to hold
          these corporations responsible for these problems, it is also
          important to acknowledge the contribution that individuals, families,
          and educational institutions make to addressing them, and how we can
          all be doing better.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          Parents and teachers can and should be educating children about the
          potential risks of social media, whilst also empowering them to make
          better decisions about their online behaviors by openly discussing
          topics such as privacy and mental health. Schools can also put in
          place digital literacy programs that instruct students on how to use
          the internet responsibly and safely. Lawmakers should also consider
          implementing regulations that shield users from the predatory
          practices of tech companies. These could include limitations on data
          gathering, requirements for more openness in the algorithms governing
          social media platforms, and restrictions on targeted advertising.

        <h1>Tweeting Ferguson</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          This article revolves around the concept of a ‘digital/subaltern
          counter-public’ under the context of Black Twitter uniting to share
          their truth during the Ferguson riots. Mainstream news media have
          consistently underplayed, distracted from, and even manipulated the
          truth when it comes to acts of violence and hatred towards people of
          color in America.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In a society that is clearly still struggling with discrimination and
          systematic racism, safe spaces are of utmost importance to minorities
          and people of color. They empower individuals to speak openly,
          interact with others who experience similar hardships, and find
          support in their common struggles. This social, psychological, and
          emotional support allows a much-needed sense of belonging, alongside
          an extra ounce of resilience to continue facing their challenges.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          With how much information we consume and communicate digitally, it's
          important that we understand we must carry over this same emphasis
          into the digital world. Social media algorithms are trained to provide
          us with content that we are most likely to engage with. Whilst this
          mostly results in the algorithm feeding us content that evokes joy and
          interest, it can also use a sense of fear and wariness that gets users
          to engage with certain content. If there’s a news story about acts of
          violence or hatred occurring in a community we are part of, or against
          an individual we identify with, it's very likely that we are driven to
          engage with it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It can therefore be extremely beneficial for many to seek out safe
          spaces and communities online that prioritize safety, empathy, and
          understanding. It can be the different between opening your phone and
          feeling alone and targeted, and opening your phone and feeling heard
          and empathized with.

        <h1>The GNU Manifesto</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          The GNU Project is a free software project launched in 1983 by
          Stallman. Its goal was to create an operating system composed entirely
          of free software. At the time of its conception, Unix was dominating
          the operating system market. For mainframe computers, their operating
          systems would cost up to thousands of dollars. Other alternatives at
          the time were cheaper but often required users to purchase separate
          licenses for each machine the software was installed on.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As an aspiring digital artist/technologist, I’m a big fan of the
          concept of open-source. It refers to software that is distributed
          along with its source code, which is the human-readable version of the
          software that can be modified and improved by anyone. The Linux
          operating system, the Apache web server, and the Firefox web browser
          are a few examples of open-source projects. I draw parallels between
          open-source and a concept described as ‘public creativity’ by write
          and scholar Eleni Meilou. “When creativity extends, by transformation,
          the experience and knowledge of others, it becomes 'public
          creativity'.” Meilou describes the process of how creative products
          when accessed by other humans, influence and inspire, and can lead to
          the conception of new ideas, products, and creations.
        </p>

          It would be incredibly ignorant for me to take complete credit for the
          work I do and the creations I share. So much of the code I type for
          the websites I create, techniques I use to model and animate in 3d,
          and film and edit videos are derived from work, tutorials, or
          information shared by other creators who attempted to solve a problem
          or express themselves within a specific domain. When we become
          conscious of and acknowledge the extent to which we rely on the
          creative efforts of others, we develop a sense of appreciation and are
          motivated to share our own progress and work in creative pursuits

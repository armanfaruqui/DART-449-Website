      <br />
      <p>
        Exhausting a Crowd is an online crowdsourced art that allows users to
        annotate anything in the pre-recorded 12 hours footage recorded by the
        street surveillance camera from cities around the world.

        My first 10 minutes on the website had me enthralled with amusement. I
        couldn't help but audibly laugh when a user-generated text box stating
        “make sure you get my good angle” appeared over the head of someone
        posing next to a statue for a photo her friend was taking. Even ones
        that didn’t make sense, such as a user tagging an interestingly shaped
        streetlight as “a public mind control device” felt like premium was
        perceived by my brain as premium entertainment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It was only when I read an article about it that I understood the
        artist’s intention behind the project. A topic much more serious than
        what my reaction led me to believe; the normalization of public
        surveillance. We can all probably think of moments in our week that we
        would prefer not to have annotated by a 14-year teenager from across the
        globe.

        But why was it that even though I’m enrolled in a university program
        which places so much importance on awareness and questioning of
        developing technologies, this idea did not even cross my mind? How could
        a project about an ethical issue become a global source of
        entertainment?

        <p>Hello. I'm Arman ارمان and my pronouns are he/him.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I grew up in Pakistan پاکستان and moved to Montreal 2 years ago to
          enroll in a fun program and hopefully find a space to feel more
          comfortable expressing myself.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I am interested in the human body, interior/scenographic design,
          meditation, and the ever-evolving capabilities of digital art.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Right now my subconscious is in a rush to make cool art and meet cool
          artists to feel a greater sense of belonging, but I'm consciously
          trying to calm it down to live more &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
